## Step by step tutorial on working with remote access!

**Step 1: Installing VS Code** <br><br>
Go to [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com) and download the latest stable build. Run installation and then open up the IDE. It should look something like the picture below. <br><br>

*Go to new file if you need to start a new assignment, open if you need to finish up something you already started and clone git repository if you need to work on a folder that is uploaded in github.* <br><br>
**Step 2: Remotely Connecting** <br>
- Go to [Link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) and change global password (but keep AD login the same). 
- Find the course specific account which is `cs15lsp22awm`. 
- As I am using a mac which already has ssh installed, open up new terminal in VS Code(in the folder that I want to connect remotely) and type in `ssh cs15lsp22awm@ieng6.ucsd.edu` which leads to the image below.<br>
- First Time <br><br>

*If it is the first time, just say yes when they ask whether you are sure you want to be connecting*<br>
- Second Time <br><br>
